## Magnetic Resonance Conductivity Imaging (MRCI) - Preproccessing
___
This is a generally applicable for **MRI B1+ phase** and **Diffusion Tensor Imaging** preprocessing for the reconstruction of anisotropic conductivity imaging. [Conductivity tensor imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8556029) is a clinically feasible method for anisotropic conductivity imaging. CTI does not require any imaging electrical current to map conductivity of biological tissues.  

### Anisotropic conductivity imaging requires diffusion tensor information in order to calculate the conductivity tensor distribution
